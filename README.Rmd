## Package overview

CohortCharacteristics contains functions for summarising characteristics of cohorts of patients identified in an OMOP CDM dataset. Once a cohort table has been created, CohortCharacteristics provides a number of functions to help provide a summary of the characteristics of the individuals within the cohort.

## Package installation

You can install the latest version of CohortCharacteristics from CRAN:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("CohortCharacteristics")
```

Or from github:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("darwin-eu-dev/CohortCharacteristics")
```

## Example usage

The CohortCharacteristics package is designed to work with data in the OMOP CDM format, so our first step is to create a reference to the data using the CDMConnector package. For this example we will work with the example Eunomia dataset.  

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CDMConnector)
library(CohortCharacteristics)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
cdm <- mockCohortCharacteristics(patient_size = 1000, drug_exposure_size = 1000)
cdm
```

We can see that in this example data we have a cohort table called cohort1.

```{r, message=FALSE}
cdm$cohort1
```

With one line of code from CohortCharacteristics we can generate summary statistics on this cohort.
```{r, message=FALSE}
cohort1_characteristics <- summariseCharacteristics(cdm$cohort1)
cohort1_characteristics |> 
  glimpse()
```

And with another line we can create a table of these results.
```{r, message=FALSE}
tableCharacteristics(cohort1_characteristics, type = "tibble")
```

CohortCharacteristics provides a number of other functions to help summarise cohort tables and present the results in publication-ready tables and figures. See the vignettes for more details.
